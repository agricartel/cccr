## Summary:
The Freedom Unlimited is a great starter catch-all card for it's solid entry into the Chase lineup while providing decent rewards. If you eat out occasionally, the 3% cash back at restaurants is great, but the other rewards aren't too useful if you don't shop at drugstores (CVS, RiteAid, etc) or travel very often. In most cases, booking travel through Chase's portal can actually be more expensive than finding deals elsewhere. So why even get the card?

Well, the Freedom Unlimited earns you Ultimate Rewards Points. These pts can be transferred to Chase Premium Cards: Sapphire Preferred and Sapphire Reserve. Both are travel cards with their own benefits and an annual fee, but allow you to increase pt value to 1.25x (Preferred) and 1.5x (Reserve) per pt when used in Chase's travel portal {10k pts = 12.5k (Preferred) = 15k (Reserve)}.  You can also amplify pt value by transferring to airline and hotel partners. For example, Marriott Bonvoy currently has a 50% transfer bonus on Chase cards, so transferring your 10k pts to them yields 15k pts with Marriot Bonvoy pts/miles. Strategic redemption can yield on avg 2 cents/pt on the 15k points = $300 of value. If you redeemed at only 10k pts through Chase cash back you only get $100 worth of value. 

*NOTE: You can only transfer to partners with Chase Sapphire or Business Ink cards*
