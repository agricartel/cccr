**Recommended Credit Score: 690 ~ 850 (Good - Excellent)**

---

**Annual Fee: $0**

---

## Benefits:
- 2% Unlimited general cash back on all categories (into your fidelity brokerage)
- 150$ sign up bonus with $1500 spend in first 3 months

---

**Personal Recommendation: Great card to fill uncategorized spending**

---

## Summary:
This is my second card and I have been using it as my catch all card after maxing my other categories. The 2% cash back is delayed a month after you pay your bill and not available super quick like some other cards. 

The App for fidelity has made progress in the last year, but its still not fantastic. Like most cards has a lot of extra benefits I never use but the card itself with just the 2% cashback (into your fidelity brokerage) is awesome.
