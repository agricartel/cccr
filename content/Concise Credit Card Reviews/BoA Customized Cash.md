## Summary:
This was my first card and it covers so many areas that it functions as a great first or only card if you wish to use it like that. This card had a choice category and the app will reccomend which category you should choose based on your previous spending with it. 

I do a lot of online shopping and with it being such a broad category (amazon, shipping labels, concert tickets, spotify, patreon, etc) this has fantastic potential to outearn a lot of other cards.

Rewards can be seen each time you make a pruchase and can get cash as a check, statement credit, or direct deposit. BoA app is fantastic and a huge selling point for this card as well.
