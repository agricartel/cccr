**Savings Accounts:** 
These are exactly what they sound like, but are a little more than meets the eye. These accounts give interest based on the interest rate the bank offers for the account. As what seems to be a rule, bigger banks will not offer anywhere close to the rate of the Federal Reserve (FED) because they dont really need to. So smaller banks who want to attract deposits offer high rates usually in line with the FED funds rate. These accounts come with insurance in the form of FDIC inurance up to 250k (single) or 500k (joint). Some other banks have more insurance or no insurance (dont use these). 
Some banks will not automatically adjust the interest rate and will require you to request the raise, I generally dont like these. Many of these smaller banks aren't really even banks, they are a comapny that makes deals with banks and moves your money around to get the best rates. As long as you are covered under FCID insurance you wont lose your money, but just choose one thats got a good reputation, interface, app, etc.
