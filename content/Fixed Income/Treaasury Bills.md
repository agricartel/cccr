**Treasury Bills:**
These are government Bonds, you pay the government money and you get its debt which pays out money at intervals through maturity. There are other types, Treasury bills (T Bills) are usually under 2 years and come in many maturity dates. 
3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 1 year, 2 years etc are examples. 

These can be purchased through a brokerage like Fidelity or bought through TreasuryDirect (dont use this lol). They typically are bought via a coupon and the difference between the coupon price and the full price extrapolated out a full year is the yield. This is a fictitious yield as it doesnt really pay interest in the way a savings account does, but it comes to full value at maturity. 

Just remember as well if you have found for example a 3 month T Bill at 5% yield, that needs to be divided by 4 as the yield is annualized. So a 3 month T Bill at 5% is a 1.25% yield over the 3 months.

These can be bought and sold in increments of 1000$ on Fidelity, I do not know the required amount for other platforms. They can also be traded once bought, so they are fairly liquid. Be aware though that if rates change drastically, the value of the T Bill can fluctuate and may not be worth the same price you paid for them, good or bad.
