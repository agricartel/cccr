**__FIXED INCOME__**:
Fixed income is very much what it sounds like and a bit more. This is where your money goes that you want to invest but you may need it soon or cant lose any principle. Generally this section had everything to do with interest rates and as such is not a static section, this will change with the economic conditions. 

The federal reserve is the United states Central bank, that means that they set the 'Federal Funds Rate' which is simply the rate in which banks lend to each other. This rate is what influences interest rates as we know them for loans or savings accounts. This comes with downsides and upsides, but when this is high, fixed income becomes fairly attractive compared to the stock market and as such, the stock market sees weakness.
