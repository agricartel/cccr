### Recommended Credit Score: N/A for student ver. OR 690 ~ 850 (Good - Excellent)
### Annual Fee: $0
## Benefits:
- 1% Unlimited general cash back on all categories.
- 5% cash back on quarterly rotating categories for up to $75 cash back (Equivalent to spending $1,500 in that category for that quarter to maximize value)
- 100% Cashback match after your first year (If you earn $200 Cashback in your first year, on your anniversary you receive an additional $200).

### Personal Recommendation: Conditionally Valuable for students with no credit history

## Summary:
The Discover IT Card is interesting. It was my first card as I had no credit history and wanted to build credit. However, it's usefulness is often cut short for 4 reasons:
- Discover isn't accepted everywhere (Costco ðŸ’€)
- Quarterly categories can be limiting 
- Points have limiting options for increasing value
- Quarterly categories order may change annually.

The Discover IT (similarly to the Chase Freedom Flex) becomes a seasonal card with the downside of not having increased point value that Chase has. It's a decent card for building credit when you have no history, but hard to utilize when you start acquiring giants like Chase, Capitol One (Cap1), and American Express (AMEX) cards. 

However, as a raw cash back card it's still very good as the points can also transfer to PayPal or Amazon very easily. However, if you can, I wouldn't recommend the Discover card in it's current state for anyone who has credit history since it's so limited. If you do have decent credit history aim for higher value cards at places you want to maximize your benefit.
