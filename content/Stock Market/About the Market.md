Long awaited investing channel is here for those who care: this is my passion and hobby at this point and I really like to talk about it. 

**__RISK:__**  
I wont tell you what companies to buy ill explain concepts and funds and stuff but what you buy is on you. You can and *will* lose money when you start, but its a learning process.

**__Why invest?__**  
You may just want to dump money in your 401k, and you should. But aving another backup that you can build over time will set you up for an earlier retirement, extra income, and more money at a better tax rate than your traditional income is. 

Also money is just fun and things are better when there is skin in the game. 

**__Why stocks over funds?__**
Well, over a long period of time, 1% over the market average is a huge deal, so that type of outperformance will net you a large amount of money. Now not everyone wants to or needs to manage a portfolio like I do, but if its interesting at all, there is a nice benefit.

Ill leave an image below over a 10 year time frame starting with $10,000:
portfolio 1: Compound annual growth rate is 22.7% (selected stocks only)
portfolio 2: Compound annual growth rate is 16.47 (moderate funds portfolio)
portfolio 3: Compound annual growth rate is 13.55 (market index - S&P 500)
